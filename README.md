# temporal-fields
Code for training temporal fully-connected CRF models in Torch

Code will be released along with the CVPR camera ready version in May 2017.

Evaluation Scripts for localization and classification are available at [allenai.org/plato/charades/](http://allenai.org/plato/charades/)

Submission files for temporal fields and baselines for classification and localization that are compatible with the official evaluation codes on [allenai.org/plato/charades/](http://allenai.org/plato/charades/) are available here: [charades_submission_files.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10728218/charades_submission_files.zip). This might be helpful for comparing and contrasting different algorithms.

Baseline Codes for Activity Localization / Classification are available at [github.com/gsig/charades-algorithms](https://github.com/gsig/charades-algorithms)
